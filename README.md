# Geophysics
A collection of geophysics projects:
   1. Seismic resolution (MATLAB): shows how the observed seismic resolution changes with layer thickness
   2. Magnetic Gradiometry (Python): interactive module to process magnetic gradient data
   3. Cole-Cole relaxation model (Python): interactive plot giving amplitude and phase curves for induced polarization
