# Geophysics
A collection of geophysics projects:
   1. Seismic resolution (MATLAB): shows how the observed seismic resolution changes with layer thickness
   2. Magnetic Gradiometry (Python): interactive module to process magnetic gradient data
   3. Cole-Cole relaxation model (Python): interactive plot giving amplitude and phase curves for induced polarization
   4. Marchenko1D (Python): provides 1D functions for acoustic modelling in 1D and applies the Marchenko equations
   5. Seismic shot (Python): cartoon on how seismic waves propagate and how shot record is created from this
