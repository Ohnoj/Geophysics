# Wave Propagation and seismic shots

Creates a cartoon depicting the propagation of a wavefield from a single source in a simple 3 layer model. 
Shows how this wavefield gets recorded in a shot record by receivers on the surface. 
Different coloring is used for different waves:
   - Red: Direct wave
   - Blue: Primary reflection
   - Green: Refraction
   - Purple: Multiple reflection
Note that the code does not provide all wavefields, and should only be used for educational purposes (e.g. no surface related multiples, or refractions from deeper depths)
