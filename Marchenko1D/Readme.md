The following scripts are available:
     1. Functions1D.py: contains the essential functions:
           - Layercac computes the response of a 1D acoustic medium
           - tdeps creates windowing operator
           - ricker creates a ricker wavelet
           - flatwave creates a flat wavelet
           - conv either convolves or correlates two traces A and B
     2. Marchenko_example.py: applies the Marchenko equations in 1D, provides redatumed (by MDD of the Green's functions) responses and overburden removal (by MDD of the focusing functions)
     3. Marchenko_uv_example.py: same as Marchenko_example.py but with the extrapolated functions (e.g. van der Neut 2016)
