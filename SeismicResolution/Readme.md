# Seismic Resolution
An example of the seismic resolution for a 10Hz ricker wavelet. 
Creates a video that shows the amplitude and apparent thickness for a increasingly thinner layer for wavelets of the same or opposite polarities.
The functions folders contains a number of functions from the CREWES matlab toolbox that are used for the example, these functions are available here:
